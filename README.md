# minimal-internet

This is a placeholder repo. No significant work has been done on this project yet.

<b>Roadmap:</b>
    
An Internet search engine filter or other software solution that limits user access to the internet.
    
Even if you make an effort to avoid time wasters and toxic content on the internet, the user is required to make
the effort to avoid which could instead be used on work. My solution is to prevent the user from even knowing such content 
even exists. It can be catagorigized based on the work profile of the user. For example, I like computers/technology.
The things I explicilty want to avoid are politics, news, celebrity gossip, clickbait lists etc. Someone who works in politics 
might want the reverse. We should both be able to get what we want.
    
Option idea, have it be configered to either a whitelist or a blacklist. 
  
Whitelist: - Only websites that meet criteria for 'important information' are presented. For example, ars technica, tech 
             journals. Everything else is blocked. 
    
Blacklist: - Block websites that are known violaters of profile. For example, I don't like politics so my blacklist would 
             include NYT, Washington Post, Huffington Post, Buzzfeed etc.
                 
        
A voluntary firewall of China situation. Plugins already exist for browsers that block access to websites. I want to avoid    
knowing the websites exist in the first place. The can't show up in search, and any links to their content much be washed from 
webpages.
